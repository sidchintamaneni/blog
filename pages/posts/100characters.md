# Project Pile: Spending Time with 100 Virtual Characters

Today morning, my friends were telling me how building personal projects has never been
this fun using coding agents. In the evening, another friend is telling me how the
Moltbook founder has been burning $20,000 every month to keep the agents running
(unverified) and how it is such a troll and funny thing to do. If you are not following
tech news, Moltbook is a social media platform for AI agents. I mean, I would've
totally done it if I had that much cash to burn.

That made me add a new project to the pile.

The idea is to create a text-based video game where a village of 100 characters,
each one carefully handcrafted with their own personality, backstory, and quirks.
You are character 0, dropped into this village, interacting with the rest of them
through text.

It's going to be inference intensive, so this one lives in the "after I can afford
enough compute (10 Mac Minis, idk)" category.

This idea is not original, I would assume it is one of the most popular ones that
people might've tried already. I recently bought a video game based on a friend's
suggestion, *[UnReal World](https://www.unrealworld.fi/)* (the developers have been
providing updates since 1992, I might write another post on them but support them
in the meanwhile if you care). Curious me started reading about the developers behind
this game and found the
*[blog posts](https://www.enormouselk.com/?q=erkkasblog/design-coding&page=0#)* by the
developer (I would highly recommend reading the rest of his posts as well) and got
inspired by the new game he is working on, Ancient Savo. Another inspiration comes
from reading the paper
*[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586183.3606763)*.
