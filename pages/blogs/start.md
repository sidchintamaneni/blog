 # Why Blog?

During my graduate school, I greatly benefited from reading blogs written by
various people. That's the motivation for me to start my own blog. I hope
someone will find my blogs useful.  

When I started grad school, Even though I hated the process of writing. Later I
found the process to be rewarding. So I want to continue that through my work
career.

If you find any mistakes or typos, please email me.  I will correct them, and
your contributions will be added to the blogs/posts.

*Except for checking grammatical errors, I don't use any AI while writing
my blogs/posts.
